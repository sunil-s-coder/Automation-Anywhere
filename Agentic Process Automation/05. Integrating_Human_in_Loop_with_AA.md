# Integrating Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) with Automation Anywhere

**Definition:**  
Human in the Loop (HITL) means that human input is intentionally integrated into an automationâ€”either at:

- The point of initiation  
- During its execution  
- Both  

To provide:

- Oversight  
- Input data  
- Apply expert judgment  
- Manage exceptions

### HITL while starting an automation  

- Automation co-pilot  
- Event Triggers  
- Business app integrations etc.  

### HITL during an execution  

- Supply missing data  
- Make a decision  
- Fix/Perfect/Approve generated outputs  

## When to use HITL  

- Exception handling  
- Quality Assurance / Subject Matter Expertise  
- Continuous improvement and feedback loops  
- Ethical and Moral considerations  
- Risk may be the biggest factor to consider  
    - Tip: If you had a new joiner on the team, would you need to check their work? if yes, then HITL is required
